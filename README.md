# git2neo

This is a small tool that imports Git metadata into a neo4j database and efficiently calculates file modification histories.

To build and run a demo example, run `./gradlew run`.

The tool is provided as is; the example generates a data sample for our ASE paper.
To reuse the tool you would probably have to fork and modify it to your needs.
