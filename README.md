# git2neo

This is a small tool that imports Git metadata into a neo4j database and efficiently calculates file modification histories.

To build and run a demo example, run `./gradlew run`.

The tool is provided as is; the example generates a data sample for [our ASE paper](https://vovak.me/publications/ase2018_branches.pdf).
To reuse the tool in other scenarios you would probably have to fork and modify it to your needs.
